In this project I implemented a program that can take in a coloured MxN image, convert it to grayscale and scale the image to a user defined aMxbN sized image while preserving the FOV.

To execute the function run the main.m script, or to test a unique aMxbN solution run:
output = scale_MN(grayScaleImg, a, b);

Further details can be found in the pdf report.
